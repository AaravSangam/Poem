Cats aren't cool
They aren't the best
They look out the window a lot 
But sometimes they scratch your face
They purr to let you know they're happy!
Dogs are not like cats
dogs are the best
Their tails wag
But dogs are big and they can scare children


Cats are better
But they are so cute and love pats
Frodo would have a cat but it would knock 
The one ring off the table

for fun.
